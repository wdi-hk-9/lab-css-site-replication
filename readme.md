# CSS Positioning Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of Instagram.com.  Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- Use display, clear, and floats to position elements on the page
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - the iPhone
  - App Store and Google Play buttons
  - Instagram Logo
  - Login button

#### Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request
- Put the link to Pull Request to the [Student Excel File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_tEPo2gGLe6K7FyWRoa0MqjO1HkxNNynU8VHvsDacY/edit#gid=0)

#### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `main.css`

#### Deliverable

Please find a screenshot of the expected result below:
